## Resources

### `mlaw_news` — Ministry of Law Singapore

- **Source**: https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/news/
- **Cadence**: Daily (Tier 1) — ~2–5 new items per week
- **Discovery**: Sitemap-based (`sitemap.xml` filtered to `/news/*` with `lastmod >= 2026-01-01`)
- **Coverage**: Press releases, speeches, parliamentary speeches, announcements, from 2026 onwards
- **Archive size**: ~450–500 items from 1999–2026; only 2026+ imported here
- **Content**: Full text scraped from `<main>` element via BeautifulSoup
- **Licensing**: All rights reserved (mlaw.gov.sg Terms of Use). Content stored but hidden
  from Datasette default view — accessible via direct SQL/FTS only.
- **UI approach**: `content_text` column intentionally not surfaced in default table view.
  `summary` (AI-generated, ~100 words) is the primary search/display field.

**Environment variables needed**:
- `LLM_BASE_URL` — Ollama base URL (e.g. `http://your-ollama-host:11434/v1`)
- `LLM_API_KEY` — placeholder (e.g. `not-needed` for Ollama)
- `LLM_MODEL` — model name (e.g. `gemma4:26b`)
- `S3_BUCKET`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` — deployment

**Scraping notes**:
- User-Agent: `ZeekerBot/1.0 (+https://data.zeeker.sg; sg-gov-newsrooms research bot)`
- Delay: 1.5s ± 0.5s between requests
- Circuit breaker: stops after 5 consecutive failures
- robots.txt: `/news/` pages are not disallowed (site is public government content)
- Retry: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (tenacity)

**Adding more agencies**: Add a new resource module in `resources/` following the same
pattern. If the agency has an RSS feed, prefer that over scraping.

### `judiciary_news` — Singapore Judiciary

- **Source**: https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/news-and-resources/news
- **Cadence**: Daily (Tier 1) — ~3–10 new items per week
- **Discovery**: Sitefinity CMS GetFilteredList AJAX endpoint (`POST /news-and-resources/news/GetFilteredList/`),
  filtered by year, paginated via `CurrentPage` (0-indexed)
- **Coverage**: Speeches, media releases, media advisories, appointments — from 2026 onwards.
  ~30 articles per year (3 pages of 10).
- **Content**: Full text scraped from `.detail-wrapper .col-md-8` on each detail page
- **Licensing**: © Government of Singapore, all rights reserved. Content stored but hidden
  from Datasette default view — accessible via direct SQL/FTS only.
- **UI approach**: `content_text` hidden; `summary` (AI-generated) is primary search field.

**Discovery endpoint**:
```
POST https://www.judiciary.gov.sg/news-and-resources/news/GetFilteredList/
Content-Type: application/json
{"model": {"CurrentPage": 0, "SelectedYear": "2026", "SearchKeywords": "", "SelectedCourts": [], "SelectedTopics": [], "SelectedContentTypes": []}}
```
Returns JSON `{listPartialView: "<html>"}`. Pagination: increment `CurrentPage` until 0 items returned.

**Scraping notes**:

## Scraping principles

All resources in this collection follow these principles:

1. **robots.txt compliance** — always check before adding a new source
2. **Polite delays** — minimum 1s between requests, with jitter
3. **User-Agent identification** — always set a descriptive bot User-Agent with contact URL
4. **Incremental only** — never re-scrape content already in the database
5. **Circuit breaker** — stop on consecutive failures, don't hammer a struggling server
6. **No personal data** — scrape institutional communications only, not individual profiles
7. **Copyright awareness** — note licensing on each resource; hide full content when unclear
8. **Per-domain rate limits** — each agency's site gets its own polite_sleep budget

## Build monitoring

Operational documentation — status-line grammar, Skip kinds (`up_to_date` /
`blocked`), `__zeeker_report__` counters (`skipped=` / `failed=`), per-resource
cadence and yields, failure modes, and backlog SQL — lives in **[RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md)**.
Monitoring agents should parse builds against that contract (or `zeeker build --json`),
not ad-hoc log scraping.

Development notes worth keeping in mind here:

- Requires **zeeker >= 0.9.0**: resources raise `from zeeker import Skip` on
  blocked preconditions, report counters via a module-level `__zeeker_report__`
  dict, and use plain top-level sibling imports (`from _isomer import ...`,
  `from _token_usage import ...`) — resources/ is on `sys.path` only while the
  module loads, so keep sibling imports at the top level (lazy in-function
  imports of siblings will fail).
- `fetch_data` runs ONCE per build per resource under 0.9.0 — no module reload,
  no second call for a fragments phase.
- Never wrap a `raise Skip(...)` inside a tenacity-retried helper — raise it
  from `fetch_data` itself (as the modules do now), or the skip would be
  retried and resurface as a RetryError failure.
